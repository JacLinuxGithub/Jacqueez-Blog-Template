                     Hello World!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My name is Jacqueez and I am a programmer who is currently writing this blog I hope you have fun reading this blog. I would say this is a simplistic minamilist website. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My goals for this website is probably reaching 1000 days (Which obciously is a unrealistic goal). If I can't do that I want atleast 365 days which is a year worth of blog posts. Next I want to upgrade the website from this random piece of junk to a a actual website.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently I haven't hosted this to the web. Right now I am just using Ritwick Dey's "Live Server" extension in Visual Studio Code.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Speaking of Live Server and Visual Studio Code. I use Visual Studio Code to code the website and the tools I used for this website is: HTML, CSS, and maybe JavaScript in the future.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Right now I really want to code a Dark Mode/Light Mode Switcher or also called a 'Theme Togglerer'. Anyways I hope good of this website.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Anyway now let's talk about the things I did so this can also be a platform where I will share my experince this day
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    So speaking of that I woke up today around 7:58 and took my tablet and watched YouTube and saw what is happening in the world. Around 9:30 ðŸ˜¬ I went to shower because I had to go to a Leadership program I signed up to. I ate my breakfast and got to the program, late Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯. I stayed there till 2:30 when I left home.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    At home I went staright to the computer and I started coding and I coded this website. TADA (â˜žï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)â˜ž â˜œ(ï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿâ˜œ). When coding I had this bug so I went to the only place I would get answers, StackOverflow. I asked the question, and while I was waiting for the answer I went outside to get some fresh air.

                    <br>
                    Bad Fact: I only had 2770 steps the whole day so ummÂ¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯

                    <br>

            <p>
               Hello World! My name is Jacqueez and I live in Alberta, Canada with my brother and parents. I started learning to code when I was 8 years old. My Uncle signed me up to one of Google Courses but this one was for kids. It was called CS First, that was my first experience of coding. In CS First I worked with block attaching website called Scratch. Then I started feeling that this was getting to easy for me so I looked into coding with language based coding languages like: Python, JavaScript, C, C++, C#, etc. While looking into that I had a thought of me thinking why not make a website so then I searched YouTube and ...
